Development Steps
Backend Development
Set up MongoDB: Create a database with collections for users, officers, admins, and complaints.
Define Models: Create Mongoose models for each collection, defining their schemas (name, email, password, role, etc. for users, officers, and admins; complaint details, location, status, images for complaints).
Create Controllers: Implement logic for handling CRUD operations for users, officers, admins, and complaints.
Define Routes: Set up API endpoints for different functionalities using Express.js routers.
Implement Authentication: Use JWT or similar for user authentication and authorization.
Image Upload: Integrate a library like multer for handling image uploads and storage.
Frontend Development
Set up React App: Create a React app using Create React App.
Component Structure: Create components for navigation, forms, maps, and data display.
User Interface: Design the user interface for different roles (admin, officer, user) using React components.
API Integration: Use Axios or Fetch API to interact with the backend API.
Map Integration: Integrate Google Maps API or a similar mapping library to display complaint locations.
State Management: Use Redux or Context API for managing application state.
Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization using local storage or cookies.
